Networks Programming Assignment 1

CSEE 4119

a) My code conists of two programs: TCPServer.py and TCPClient.py, both written in python. TCPServer.py acts as a chatroom server and contains almost all methods described in the rubric. TCPClient.py acts as a client and takes in user input through the console and sends it through the server to other clients. Both run accordingly as they should and output just like the examples given. Users should be able to follow the instructions when running the programs.

b) Programmed exclusively on Sublime Text and consistently tested it through Terminal (and CUNIX) on my laptop.

c) To run TCPServer.py, enter "python TCPServer.py <port number>". To run TCPClient.py, enter "python TCPClient.py <ip address> <port number>". Since these are Python programs, no Makefile is needed.

e) No extra features.
